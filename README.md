# Pagination

It's a pagination react project. You can find the links 
of our pagination in the bottom of the view.
You can navigate between 10 different pages via the links.
10 posts will be displayed per page. 

I've used React hooks like createRef, useEffect, useState.
In addition, I've used the JSONPlaceholder fake api to fetch posts, Bootstrap Component Framework for styling, Axios Promise based HTTP client to send the request and handle it.
